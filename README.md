# JS Restaurant Page- The Odin Project

This is a project completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) Javascript Curriculum.

This project implements a script which dynamically renders content by separate modules, each of which is imported from its own separate javascript file. These separate javascript files are then bundled into a single 'main.js' file in the 'dist' directory.

Dependencies can be installed by running `npm install` if node.js is installed.

To get started, clone the repo and run 'dist.index.html' in a browser.
